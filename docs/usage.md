## linear cli

### usage

linear cli provides commands to manage linear issues, teams, and projects from the command line.

### repo configuration

first, configure the cli with your linear api token:

```bash
linear config
```

this will interactively generate a `.linear.toml` configuration file in the repo.

### issues

#### list issues

list your issues (shows unstarted issues by default):

```bash
linear issue list
```

list issues with different states:

```bash
# List started issues
linear issue list --state started

# List all issues regardless of state  
linear issue list --all-states

# List multiple states
linear issue list --state unstarted --state started

# A state name or ID works too, and mixes with types
linear issue list --state "In Review"
linear issue list --state started --state "In Review"
```

filter by assignee:

```bash
# List issues assigned to you
linear issue list --assignee self

# List issues assigned to specific user
linear issue list --assignee username

# List all unassigned issues
linear issue list --unassigned

# List issues for all assignees
linear issue list --all-assignees
```

other options:

```bash
# List issues for specific team (key, name, or ID)
linear issue list --team TEAM
linear issue list --team "Team Name"

# Sort by priority instead of manual order
linear issue list --sort priority

# Open in web browser
linear issue list --web

# Open in Linear app
linear issue list --app
```

#### view issue details

view the current issue (based on git branch):

```bash
linear issue view
```

view a specific issue:

```bash
linear issue view TEAM-123
```

view options:

```bash
# Open in web browser
linear issue view TEAM-123 --web

# Open in Linear app  
linear issue view TEAM-123 --app

# Exclude comments from output
linear issue view TEAM-123 --no-comments
```

#### start working on an issue

start the next available issue:

```bash
linear issue start
```

start a specific issue:

```bash
linear issue start TEAM-123
```

this will move the issue to "in progress" and create a git branch.

#### create an issue

create an issue interactively:

```bash
linear issue create
```

create with specific options:

```bash
# Create with title and description
linear issue create --title "Fix bug" --description "Description here"

# Create and assign to yourself
linear issue create --assignee self

# Create with priority (1-4, where 1 is highest)
linear issue create --priority 1

# Create with estimate points
linear issue create --estimate 3

# Create with labels
linear issue create --label bug --label frontend

# Create for specific team (key, name, or ID)
linear issue create --team TEAM

# Create and start working on it
linear issue create --start
```

create from a template (name or ID, applied by Linear server-side):

```bash
# The template supplies the title, body, and fields; --title is optional
linear issue create --team ENG --template "Bug report"

# Flags you pass override the template's values; labels merge with the template's
linear issue create --team ENG --template "Bug report" --title "Login fails" --label security

# --description replaces the template body; leave it out to keep the body
linear issue create --team ENG --template "Bug report" --description "Just this text"
```

`--template` takes the place of the team's default template (`--no-use-default-template` is implied; passing it too is fine). See [templates](#templates) for listing and inspecting them.

#### update an issue

update the current issue:

```bash
linear issue update
```

update a specific issue:

```bash
linear issue update TEAM-123
```

change labels:

```bash
# Add a label, keeping existing labels
linear issue update TEAM-123 --add-label bug

# Remove a label from this issue (does not delete it from the team)
linear issue update TEAM-123 --remove-label sprint-42

# Swap labels atomically in one update
linear issue update TEAM-123 --remove-label sprint-42 --add-label sprint-43

# Replace the entire label set
linear issue update TEAM-123 --label bug --label frontend
```

clear optional fields (each `--clear-*` flag conflicts with its set flag):

```bash
# Remove the due date, estimate, parent, project, or milestone
linear issue update TEAM-123 --clear-due-date
linear issue update TEAM-123 --clear-estimate --clear-parent
linear issue update TEAM-123 --clear-project --clear-milestone

# Move to another project and detach the milestone in one update
linear issue update TEAM-123 --project "Mobile App" --clear-milestone

# Assignee and cycle have their own clearing flags
linear issue update TEAM-123 --unassign --clear-cycle
```

#### other issue commands

get issue id from current git branch:

```bash
linear issue id
```

get issue title:

```bash
linear issue title TEAM-123
```

get issue url:

```bash
linear issue url TEAM-123
```

create a github pull request:

```bash
linear issue pull-request
linear issue pr  # Short alias
```

delete an issue:

```bash
linear issue delete TEAM-123
```

archive an issue:

```bash
linear issue archive TEAM-123 --confirm
linear issue archive --confirm --bulk TEAM-123 TEAM-124   # several at once; --bulk-file and --bulk-stdin also work
```

Archiving is normally something Linear does for you, not something you do by hand. Linear's [delete and archive issues](https://linear.app/docs/delete-archive-issues) docs state that "archiving happens automatically with no option to manually archive items": closed issues are auto-archived after the period set in Team settings, and the manual action Linear offers is delete, which keeps the issue in the trash for 30 days. Linear removed manual archiving from its app in 2021 because "most users used the archive as a trash can", reasoning that "the archive is something that Linear should manage for you while deleting issues is your own choice" ([changelog](https://linear.app/changelog/2021-04-15-auto-archive-cycles-and-projects-and-deleting-issues)). Its official MCP server has no archive tool either.

`issue archive` calls the `issueArchive` mutation directly, so it skips the checks auto-archive applies (open parent, open sub-issues, active cycle or project), and archived issues disappear from `issue list`, `issue query`, and search unless you pass `--include-archived`. Reach for it only when an issue should leave the active workspace without being canceled or trashed; otherwise close it with `issue update --state` or remove it with `issue delete`. Archived issues can be restored from the team's archives page in Linear.

#### issue comments

```bash
# List comments (threads, newest first); --json keeps the GraphQL connection
linear issue comment list TEAM-123
linear issue comment list TEAM-123 --json

# Add a comment; --body-file is preferred for markdown
linear issue comment add TEAM-123 --body "Reproduced on staging"
linear issue comment add TEAM-123 --body-file notes.md

# Reply to a top-level comment (-p / --parent are aliases of --reply-to)
linear issue comment add TEAM-123 --body "Fixed in #42" --reply-to COMMENT-ID
```

### teams

wherever a command takes a team, pass its key, its name, or its UUID. keys are canonical; an unknown team errors and lists the valid keys.

#### list teams

```bash
linear team list
linear team list --json   # machine-readable, e.g. to map a team name to its key
```

#### get team id

get team id derived from repository name:

```bash
linear team id
```

#### team members

list members of your default team:

```bash
linear team members
```

list members of a specific team:

```bash
linear team members TEAM
linear team members "Team Name"
```

#### create a team

```bash
linear team create
```

#### configure github autolinks

set up github repository autolinks for linear issues:

```bash
linear team autolinks
```

### projects

#### create a project

```bash
# Create with a short description and long-form overview markdown
linear project create --name "API v2" --team ENG --description "Short summary" --content "## Overview"

# Read the project overview body from a markdown file
linear project create --name "API v2" --team ENG --content-file overview.md

# Create with priority, labels, members, icon, and color
linear project create --name "Mobile launch" --team APP --priority high --label Launch --member jane@example.com --icon rocket --color "#5E6AD2"

# Create from a project template (name or ID); explicit flags override the template's values
linear project create --name "Q3 launch" --team APP --template "Kickoff"
```

#### update a project

```bash
# --description is the short summary; --content is the long-form overview body
linear project update PROJECT-ID --description "Short summary" --content "## Overview"

# Replace the overview body from a markdown file
linear project update PROJECT-ID --content-file overview.md

# Remove the lead, start date, or target date (each conflicts with its set flag)
linear project update PROJECT-ID --clear-lead --clear-start-date --clear-target-date

# Teams, labels, and initiatives are sets. --team, --label, and --initiative
# replace the whole set; --add-*/--remove-* change it incrementally. All are
# repeatable, and a replace flag cannot be combined with its add/remove flags.
linear project update PROJECT-ID --add-team OPS --remove-team APP
linear project update PROJECT-ID --add-label Launch --remove-label Beta
linear project update PROJECT-ID --add-initiative "Q4 Bets"     # ID, slug, or name
linear project update PROJECT-ID --initiative "Q4 Bets" --initiative "Platform"  # exactly these
# Removing a team, label, or initiative the project does not have is an error.
```

#### list projects

```bash
linear project list
```

#### view project details

```bash
linear project view PROJECT-ID
linear project view PROJECT-ID --json
```

#### project comments

```bash
# A project is a UUID, slug ID, or exact name
linear project comment list "Mobile launch"
linear project comment list PROJECT-ID --json

linear project comment add PROJECT-ID --body "Kickoff is Monday"
linear project comment add PROJECT-ID --body-file update.md --reply-to COMMENT-ID
```

### documents and initiatives

Documents and initiatives take the same `comment list` and `comment add` subcommands as issues and projects. A document is a UUID or slug; an initiative is a UUID, slug, or name.

```bash
linear document comment list DOC-SLUG          # inline comments show the text they quote
linear document comment list DOC-SLUG --json   # quotedText and parent are in the JSON
linear document comment add DOC-SLUG --body-file review.md
linear document comment add DOC-SLUG --body "Agreed" --reply-to COMMENT-ID

linear initiative comment list "Platform"
linear initiative comment add "Platform" --body "Scope locked for Q3"
```

### templates

Linear templates pre-fill an issue, project, or document. A template belongs to a team or to the whole workspace; team templates are only available in that team, workspace templates everywhere.

#### list templates

```bash
linear template list                          # every template in the workspace
linear template list --type issue             # issue, project, or document
linear template list --team ENG               # ENG's templates plus workspace-level ones
linear template list --type project --json    # raw template objects, after the same filtering and ordering as the table
```

#### view a template

```bash
linear template view "Bug report"             # by name (exact, case-insensitive)
linear template view <template-id>            # by ID; needed when the same name exists in several teams
linear template view "Bug report" --json      # raw GraphQL object
linear template view "Bug report" --json | jq '.templateData | fromjson'   # decode the pre-filled data
```

The human view prints the template's metadata and then every key of its pre-filled data: title, priority, estimate, labels, state, sub-issues, and the body (Linear stores the body as rich text; it is shown as markdown). References come back as IDs, which `linear team states`, `linear label list`, and `linear user list` can map to names.

#### apply a template

Pass `--template <name|id>` to `issue create` or `project create`. Linear applies the template server-side on create; the CLI only sends the template's ID.

- Anything you pass explicitly (title, priority, state, description, and so on) overrides the template's value.
- `--label` merges with the template's labels rather than replacing them.
- `--description` replaces the template body. Leave it out to keep the body.
- `issue create --template` makes `--title` optional and takes the place of the team's default template (`--no-use-default-template` is implied and may be passed as well).
- Document templates can be listed and viewed, but Linear's API offers no way to apply one when creating a document, so `document create` has no `--template` flag.

### shell completions

generate shell completions for better command-line experience:

```bash
# For bash
source <(linear completions bash)

# For zsh  
source <(linear completions zsh)

# For fish
linear completions fish | source
```

add the appropriate line to your shell's configuration file (e.g., `~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`, or `~/.config/fish/config.fish`).

### global options

most commands support these options:

- `--no-pager` - disable automatic paging for long output
- `--no-color` - disable colored output
- `--help` - show help for the command

### examples

common workflows:

```bash
# Start working on the next issue
linear issue start

# View current issue details
linear issue view

# Create and start a new bug fix
linear issue create --title "Fix login error" --label bug --start

# List high priority issues
linear issue list --sort priority

# Create a pull request for current issue
linear issue pr
```
