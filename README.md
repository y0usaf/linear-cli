# linear cli

a cli to list, start and create issues in the [linear](https://linear.app/) issue tracker. git and [jj](https://www.jj-vcs.dev/) aware to keep you in the right views in linear. allows jumping to the web or the linear desktop app similar to `gh`.

**works great with AI agents** — the CLI includes a [skill](#skills) that lets agents create issues, update status, and manage your Linear workflow alongside your code.

here's how it works:

```bash
linear config               # setup your repo, it writes a config file

linear issue mine           # list unstarted issues assigned to you
linear issue query --all-teams  # query issues across all teams
linear issue query --search "login bug"  # search issues in your configured team
linear issue start          # choose an issue to start, creates a branch
linear issue start ABC-123  # start a specific issue
linear issue view           # see current branch's issue as markdown
linear issue pr             # makes a PR with title/body preset, using gh cli
linear issue create         # create a new issue
```

it aims to be a complement to the web and desktop apps that lets you stay on the command line in an interactive or scripted way.

## install

### homebrew

```
brew install schpet/tap/linear
```

### deno via jsr

```bash
deno install -A --reload -f -g -n linear jsr:@schpet/linear-cli
```

### npm / bun / pnpm

install as a dev dependency to pin a version in your project:

```bash
npm install -D @schpet/linear-cli
# or
bun add -D @schpet/linear-cli
# or
pnpm add -D @schpet/linear-cli
```

then run via your package manager:

```bash
npx linear issue list
bunx linear issue list
```

> **note:** this package ships pre-built binaries

package on npm: [@schpet/linear-cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@schpet/linear-cli)

### binaries

https://github.com/schpet/linear-cli/releases/latest

### local dev

```bash
git clone https://github.com/schpet/linear-cli
cd linear-cli
deno task install
```

## setup

1. create an API key at [linear.app/settings/account/security](https://linear.app/settings/account/security)[^1]

2. authenticate with the CLI:

   ```sh
   linear auth login
   ```

3. configure your project:

   ```sh
   cd my-project-repo
   linear config
   ```

see [docs/authentication.md](docs/authentication.md) for multi-workspace support and other authentication options.

the CLI works with both git and jj version control systems:

- **git**: works best when your branches include Linear issue IDs (e.g. `eng-123-my-feature`). use `linear issue start` or linear UI's 'copy git branch name' button and [related automations](https://linear.app/docs/account-preferences#git-related-automations).
- **jj**: detects issues from `Linear-issue` trailers in your commit descriptions. use `linear issue start` to automatically add the trailer, or add it manually with `jj describe`, e.g. `jj describe "$(linear issue describe ABC-123)"`

## commands

### issue commands

the current issue is determined by:

- **git**: the issue id in the current branch name (e.g. `eng-123-my-feature`)
- **jj**: the `Linear-issue` trailer in the current or ancestor commits

note that [Linear's GitHub integration](https://linear.app/docs/github#branch-format) will suggest git branch names.

```bash
linear issue view      # view current issue details in terminal
linear issue view ABC-123
linear issue view 123
linear issue view -w   # open issue in web browser
linear issue view -a   # open issue in Linear.app
linear issue id        # prints the issue id from current branch (e.g., "ENG-123")
linear issue title     # prints just the issue title
linear issue url       # prints the Linear.app URL for the issue
linear issue pr        # creates a GitHub PR with issue details via `gh pr create`
linear issue list      # list your issues in a table view (supports -s/--state and --sort)
linear issue list --project "My Project" --milestone "Phase 1"  # filter by milestone
linear issue list -w   # open issue list in web browser
linear issue list -a   # open issue list in Linear.app
linear issue query --search "login bug"  # search issues by text in your configured team
linear issue query --search "oauth timeout" --team ENG --json  # structured search output for agents
linear issue query --team "Engineering" --state "In Review" --json  # teams by key, name, or ID; states by type, name, or ID
linear issue query --all-teams --json --limit 0  # export all issues as JSON
linear issue start     # create/switch to issue branch and mark as started
linear issue create    # create a new issue (interactive prompts)
linear issue create -t "title" -d "description"  # create with flags
linear issue create --project "My Project" --milestone "Phase 1"  # create with milestone
linear issue update    # update an issue (interactive prompts)
linear issue update ENG-123 --milestone "Phase 2"  # set milestone on existing issue
linear issue update ENG-123 --clear-due-date --clear-parent  # remove values (also --clear-estimate, --clear-project, --clear-milestone, --clear-cycle, --unassign)
linear issue delete    # delete an issue
linear issue comment list          # list comments on current issue
linear issue comment add           # add a comment to current issue
linear issue comment add --reply-to <id>   # reply to a comment (-p / --parent are aliases)
linear issue comment list --json   # comments as JSON, with quotedText and parent for inline comments and replies
linear issue comment update <id>   # update a comment
linear issue commits               # show all commits for an issue (jj only)
```

#### attaching files

attach files to an issue or comment. uploads are **private** by default (readable only by workspace members), matching the Linear web app.

```bash
linear issue attach ENG-123 ./screenshot.png            # attach a file to an issue
linear issue attach ENG-123 ./doc.pdf -t "Spec"         # custom attachment title
linear issue attach ENG-123 ./img.png -c "see this"     # add a linked comment
linear issue comment add ENG-123 -a ./screenshot.png    # attach a file to a comment
linear issue comment add ENG-123 -a ./a.png -a ./b.png  # attach multiple files
```

by default attachments are private. pass `--public` to upload raster images (png/jpeg/gif/webp/bmp/tiff) to a public `public.linear.app` URL readable by **anyone, unauthenticated** — useful for sharing outside the workspace, but a warning is printed since it bypasses workspace access controls. non-image files cannot be made public.

```bash
linear issue attach ENG-123 ./screenshot.png --public           # public image URL
linear issue comment add ENG-123 -a ./screenshot.png --public   # public image URL
```

### team commands

```bash
linear team list       # list teams
linear team list --json  # as JSON, e.g. to map a team name to its key or id in scripts
linear team id         # print out the team id (e.g. for scripts)
linear team members    # list team members
linear team members --all --json  # include inactive members, as JSON
linear team create     # create a new team
linear team autolinks  # configure GitHub repository autolinks for Linear issues
```

### user commands

```bash
linear user list        # list everyone in the workspace
linear user list --all  # include deactivated members
linear user list --json # machine-readable output
```

### project commands

```bash
linear project list    # list projects
linear project view    # view project details
linear project view <projectId> --json  # project details as JSON
linear project create --name "API v2" --team ENG --content-file overview.md
linear project create --name "Mobile launch" --team APP --priority high --label Launch --member jane@example.com
linear project update <projectId> --content-file overview.md  # replace the project's overview body
linear project update <projectId> --clear-lead --clear-target-date  # remove values (also --clear-start-date)

```

### document commands

manage Linear documents from the command line. every document is attached to exactly one target: a project, issue, initiative, team, cycle, or release (Linear's API requires one).

```bash
# list documents
linear document list                            # list all accessible documents
linear docs list                                # alias for document
linear document list --project <project>        # filter by project (UUID, slug ID, or name)
linear document list --issue TC-123             # filter by issue
linear document list --team ENG                 # filter by team
linear document list --initiative <initiative>  # filter by initiative
linear document list --team ENG --cycle active  # filter by cycle (team scopes the lookup)
linear document list --release <release>        # filter by release (UUID, name, or version)
linear document list --json                     # output as JSON

# view a document
linear document view <slug>                     # view document rendered in terminal
linear document view <slug> --raw               # output raw markdown (for piping)
linear document view <slug> --web               # open in browser
linear document view <slug> --json              # output as JSON, including document comments

# comment on a document
linear document comment list <slug>             # list comments; inline comments show the text they quote
linear document comment list <slug> --json      # comments as JSON (quotedText, parent, ...)
linear document comment add <slug> --body "Looks good"              # add a top-level comment
linear document comment add <slug> --body-file note.md --reply-to <commentId>  # reply in a thread

# create a document (exactly one attachment target is required)
linear document create --title "Doc" --project <project>              # attach to project
linear document create --title "Notes" --issue TC-123                 # attach to issue
linear document create --title "Handbook" --team ENG                  # attach to team
linear document create --title "Brief" --initiative <initiative>      # attach to initiative
linear document create --title "Sprint" --team ENG --cycle next       # attach to cycle
linear document create --title "Notes" --release 2026.8               # attach to release
linear document create --title "Spec" --content-file ./spec.md --project <project>  # content from file
cat spec.md | linear document create --title "Spec" --project <project>             # content from stdin

# update a document
linear document update <slug> --title "New Title"                     # update title
linear document update <slug> --content-file ./updated.md             # update content
linear document update <slug> --edit                                  # open in $EDITOR
linear document update <slug> --team ENG                              # re-point attachment (replaces current)
linear document update <slug> --content-file ./updated.md --force     # bypass comment-anchor guard

# delete a document
linear document delete <slug>                   # soft delete (move to trash)
linear document delete <slug> --permanent       # permanent delete
linear document delete --bulk <slug1> <slug2>   # bulk delete
```

content updates are refused by default when a document has active inline Linear comments, because replacing markdown can detach or hide those anchors. top-level document comments do not block updates. review the inline comment first, then rerun with `--force` if you intentionally want to replace the content anyway.

### other commands

```bash
linear --help          # show all commands
linear --version       # show version
linear config          # setup the project
linear completions     # generate shell completions
```

## configuration options

the CLI supports configuration via environment variables or a `.linear.toml` config file. environment variables take precedence over config file values.

| option          | env var                           | toml key                   | example                              | description                                                                                      |

the config file can be placed at (checked in order, first found is used):

- `./linear.toml` or `./.linear.toml` (current directory)
- `<repo-root>/linear.toml` or `<repo-root>/.linear.toml` (repository root)
- `<repo-root>/.config/linear.toml`
- `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/linear/linear.toml` or `~/.config/linear/linear.toml` (Unix)
- `%APPDATA%\linear\linear.toml` (Windows)

## skills

linear-cli includes a skill that helps AI agents use the CLI effectively. for use cases outside the CLI, it includes instructions to interact directly with the graphql api, including authentication.

### claude code

install the skill using [claude code's plugin system](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/skills):

```bash
# from claude code
/plugin marketplace add schpet/linear-cli
/plugin install linear-cli@linear-cli

# from bash
claude plugin marketplace add schpet/linear-cli
claude plugin install linear-cli@linear-cli

# to update
claude plugin marketplace update linear-cli
claude plugin update linear-cli@linear-cli
```

### skills.sh for other agents

install the skill using [skills.sh](https://skills.sh):

```bash
npx skills add schpet/linear-cli
```

view the skill at [skills.sh/schpet/linear-cli/linear-cli](https://skills.sh/schpet/linear-cli/linear-cli)

## development

### updating skill documentation

the skill documentation in `skills/linear-cli/` is automatically generated from the CLI help text. after making changes to commands or help text, regenerate the docs:

```bash
deno task generate-skill-docs
```

this will:

- discover all commands and subcommands from `linear --help`
- generate reference documentation for each command
- update the `SKILL.md` file from `SKILL.template.md`

**important:** the CI checks will fail if the generated docs are out of date, so make sure to run this before committing changes that affect command structure or help text.

### code formatting

ensure code is formatted consistently:

```bash
deno fmt
```

the project uses deno's built-in formatter with configuration in `deno.json`. formatting is checked in CI.

## why

linear's UI is incredibly good but it slows me down. i find the following pretty grating to experience frequently:

- switching context from my repo to linear
- not being on the right view when i open linear
- linear suggests a git branch, but i have to do the work of creating or switching to that branch
- linear's suggested git branch doesn't account for it already existing or having a merged pull request

this cli solves this. it knows what you're working on (via git branches or jj commit trailers), does the work of managing your version control state, and will write your pull request details for you.

[^1]: creating an API key requires member access, it is not available for guest accounts.
