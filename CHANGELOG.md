# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `document comment list|add`, `project comment list|add`, and `initiative comment list|add`, mirroring `issue comment`. Documents take a UUID or slug, projects and initiatives a UUID, slug, or name; `add` takes `--body` or `--body-file`. Every comment `add`, including `issue comment add`, now takes `--reply-to <commentId>` to answer in a thread (`-p`/`--parent` remain aliases). Comment lists now fetch every page instead of stopping at 50, and their `--json` nodes, plus the comments in `issue view --json`, carry `quotedText` (the passage an inline comment is anchored to) alongside `parent.id` ([#230](https://github.com/schpet/linear-cli/issues/230))
- every command that takes a team now accepts its key, name, or UUID, resolved through one shared lookup: `team states`, `team members`, `team delete`, `label list/create/delete --team`, `cycle list/view --team`, `project list/create/update --team`, `document list/create/update --team`, and `issue query/mine/create/update --team`. Keys stay canonical and win over a same-spelled name; an unknown team errors with the list of valid keys instead of an empty result or a raw API error. Previously only keys worked, which is why [#276](https://github.com/schpet/linear-cli/issues/276) asked for `team list --json` as a name-to-key lookup
- `issue query --state` and `issue mine --state` accept a workflow state name or ID as well as the six state types, looked up within the queried team scope (all teams under `--all-teams`, where a name matches every team's same-named state). An unknown name errors and lists the scope's states, and types and names can be mixed
- `project update --content <markdown>` and `--content-file <path>` replace a project's long-form overview body, matching the flags `project create` already had. Previously the only way to change the body after creation was a hand-written `projectUpdate` mutation through `linear api`
- `issue update --clear-due-date`, `--clear-estimate`, `--clear-parent`, `--clear-project`, and `--clear-milestone`, plus `project update --clear-lead`, `--clear-start-date`, and `--clear-target-date`, to remove a value the way `--unassign` and `--clear-cycle` already do. Each sends an explicit `null` to Linear and errors when combined with its set flag; `--clear-project` also rejects `--milestone`, since a milestone belongs to the project being removed. Previously these fields could only be changed, never cleared: cliffy treats `--due-date ""` as a missing value
- `--json` (`-j`) on `team list`, `cycle list`, `cycle view`, `milestone list`, `milestone view`, and `project view`, the last read commands without machine-readable output. List commands emit the same `{ nodes, pageInfo }` connection shape as the other list commands, after the same filtering and ordering as the table; view commands emit the GraphQL object as fetched, including every issue rather than the ten-item preview, and `milestone view --all --json` includes every page. (A 2.0.0 entry claimed `cycle list --json`; that change never actually landed.) ([#276](https://github.com/schpet/linear-cli/issues/276); thanks @lakardion)

### Fixed

- an unknown document, project, initiative, or issue passed to `document view` or any `comment` command is reported as `<Type> not found: <reference>` instead of Linear's raw "Could not find referenced …" wording, and `document view` no longer exits with a stack trace for an unknown slug (its not-found branch re-threw instead of reporting, and was unreachable until the not-found detection was fixed)
- `cycle list` and `milestone list` now paginate instead of taking Linear's default page, so a team with more than 50 cycles or a project with more than 50 milestones is no longer silently truncated

## [2.6.0] - 2026-09-02

### Added

- `team members --json` and `user list --json` now include each member's canonical Linear `url`, so callers can create real Markdown mentions without guessing profile slugs
- `issue pr` accepts `--template/-T <file>` to start the pull request body from a template file, with a `pr_template` config option (`LINEAR_PR_TEMPLATE`) as a per-project default and `--no-template` to skip that default for one invocation. The Linear issue URL is appended after the template, so the pull request stays linked to its issue ([#266](https://github.com/schpet/linear-cli/pull/266); thanks @maparent)
- issue comment list --json now exposes stable author identity: `user.id`, `externalUser.id`, and a `botActor` object (`id`, `name`, `type`, `subType`) for comments posted by integrations. Display names are editable and can collide across a workspace — an external user's display name can even match a real member's — so programs consuming the JSON previously had nothing reliable to attribute a comment with ([#268](https://github.com/schpet/linear-cli/pull/268); thanks @leonardsellem)
- issue comment list --json now includes `editedAt`, which is set only when a comment's author revised it. `updatedAt` also moves for unrelated backend churn, so it could not answer "has this been changed since it was written?" ([#268](https://github.com/schpet/linear-cli/pull/268); thanks @leonardsellem)
- `LINEAR_IGNORE_ENV_FILE=1` skips `.env` loading entirely, for repositories whose `.env` is not dotenv-shaped

### Changed

- CLI help now explains how to create real Linear Markdown mentions and collapsible sections, so an agent driving the CLI without the bundled skill still gets it right. The ten commands that take a Markdown body carry the rule inline (`@name` mentions nobody; a plain Linear URL does) and point at a new `linear markdown` reference, and `team members --json` / `user list --json` say what the `url` field is for
- `issue mine`, `issue query`, `issue start`, and `team states` now group statuses in the same order as the Linear app: by workflow state type, then by the team's configured position within that type. Issue listings previously ran the order backwards (canceled and done first), and every status list sorted on raw position alone, which stranded a late-positioned status such as an "In Review" at position 1002 after "Duplicate" instead of beside "In Progress"
- when `--limit` truncates an issue listing, the retained issues are now the most actionable rather than the most recently closed. The Linear API cannot sort by a team's configured positions, so it still selects which issues are fetched; that selection changed from closed-first to open-first. A status this build does not recognize sorts after all known ones
- an unquoted `$VAR` reference in a `LINEAR_`/`GH_`/`GITHUB_` value is now skipped with a warning rather than expanded. Expansion of an unset variable silently produced the string `"undefined"`, and a self-referential one hung. Quoted values are unaffected, since dotenv never expanded those
- issue query no longer prints the "using default team" note when the team comes from the project's own linear.toml or .env. The note exists to flag ambient defaults — a global config file or an exported LINEAR_TEAM_ID — silently narrowing a query; explicit, directory-scoped project configuration is not ambient, so the reminder was just noise on every query

### Fixed

- linear no longer crashes on startup when `.env` is a directory rather than a file, and no longer hangs forever on a `.env` written to be `source`d by a shell (a self-referential value such as `export PATH=$PATH:/opt/bin` spun the dotenv expander's loop indefinitely). An unusable `.env` is now reported as a warning on stderr and skipped, and the repository-root `.env` is still consulted as a fallback ([#265](https://github.com/schpet/linear-cli/pull/265); thanks @jackarch-2 for the fix and the report in [#264](https://github.com/schpet/linear-cli/issues/264))
- issue comment list showed `@Unknown` for every comment posted by an integration or bot, because the query never asked for `botActor`; those comments now render the bot's name (falling back to its type)
- issue comment add --id now rejects a value that is not a v4 UUID (the format Linear documents for the field) with an actionable error, instead of forwarding it and surfacing a raw API error

## [2.5.0] - 2026-08-11

### Changed

- document create now requires exactly one attachment target and errors clearly when none or several are given (Linear's API no longer allows workspace-level documents); the interactive prompt's broken "workspace document" option was removed

### Fixed

- document list --project now accepts a project UUID, slug ID, or name — previously it silently matched slug IDs only and returned an empty list for names

### Added

- document create, update, and list now support all six attachment targets: --project, --issue, --initiative, --team, --cycle, and --release (with --team scoping --cycle like the issue commands); document view and list display whichever target a document has
- document update can re-point a document to a different target, including the previously missing --issue

## [2.4.0] - 2026-08-05

### Added

- `issue update --add-label` and `--remove-label` to change an issue's labels incrementally: add a label without clobbering the existing set, or detach a label from one issue without deleting it team-wide ([#258](https://github.com/schpet/linear-cli/issues/258); thanks @rez0 for the report). Both may be repeated and combined for an atomic swap (`--remove-label sprint-42 --add-label sprint-43`)

### Changed

- `issue update --label` help text now states that it replaces the issue's entire label set (it always did; the docs previously suggested it added labels)

## [2.3.1] - 2026-08-04

### Fixed

- `document list --issue` now returns documents instead of failing; it filtered on a nonexistent `IssueFilter.identifier` field, so the flag was rejected by the API on every invocation

## [2.3.0] - 2026-07-23

### Added

- "Common Tasks" recipes in the agent skill, including how to attach an image so it renders inline in a comment (eval-validated against agent behavior)

### Changed

- `issue attach` now reports that it created a sidebar link attachment and, for images, prints a copy-pasteable hint suggesting `issue comment add --attach` for inline display
- `issue list`/`issue mine` now sort by priority by default (configurable via `issue_sort`); an invalid configured sort errors instead of silently defaulting ([#253](https://github.com/schpet/linear-cli/pull/253); thanks @friederbluemle)
- `issue mine` without a configured team now explains how to set one up, and suggests `linear config` when run inside a repo

## [2.2.0] - 2026-07-22

### Fixed

- `issue query --search` no longer silently drops the `--cycle` filter
- `team members --all` now actually includes disabled members (the flag was previously a no-op)
- Error suggestions now point at the real `linear config` command instead of the nonexistent `linear configure`

### Added

- Cycle information in issue lists and `issue view`: a compact CYC column (for teams with cycles enabled) and cycle flags in `--json` output
- Relative cycle references (`now`, `next`, `previous`, signed offsets like `+1`) accepted by `--cycle` on issue query/mine/create/update and `cycle view`, plus `issue update --clear-cycle` to remove an issue from its cycle
- `linear user list` (alias `u`) to list all workspace members, `team members --json` output, and admin/owner/you role markers in member listings
- `issue update --unassign` to clear an issue's assignee
- `document update --project` to change which project a document is attached to
- `linear team states` command to list a team's workflow states; a wrong `--state` on `issue create`/`issue update` now errors with the list of valid states
- `configure` as an alias for the `config` command

## [2.1.1] - 2026-07-15

### Fixed

- stop treating linux keyring failures as a missing password, and preserve secrets verbatim instead of trimming secret-tool output ([#244](https://github.com/schpet/linear-cli/pull/244); thanks @mezuzza)

## [2.1.0] - 2026-07-14

### Security

- default attachment uploads to private, and add --public to issue attach and issue comment add to opt into a public url for raster images ([#234](https://github.com/schpet/linear-cli/pull/234); thanks @tjmgregory)

### Fixed

- accept a uuid, slug id, or name for --project and --milestone across issue, milestone, and document commands ([#229](https://github.com/schpet/linear-cli/pull/229); thanks @jrschumacher)
- surface truncation in milestone view instead of silently capping the issue list, and add --all to paginate ([#228](https://github.com/schpet/linear-cli/pull/228); thanks @jrschumacher)
- allow issue create --project to stay interactive instead of failing with "title is required when not using interactive mode" ([#208](https://github.com/schpet/linear-cli/pull/208); thanks @mbuvarp)

### Added

- add labels to issue view --json output ([#170](https://github.com/schpet/linear-cli/pull/170); thanks @RengarLee)
- add --content and --content-file to project create for project overview markdown, plus priority, label, member, icon, and color fields ([#216](https://github.com/schpet/linear-cli/pull/216); thanks @CodeWithBryan)
- add --label to project update to set a project's labels ([#226](https://github.com/schpet/linear-cli/pull/226); thanks @KinomotoMio)
- add --description-file to project create and update, and reject descriptions over the 255-character api limit client-side ([#227](https://github.com/schpet/linear-cli/pull/227); thanks @jrschumacher)
- add optional project selection to interactive issue create, gated behind the issue_create_ask_project config option ([#208](https://github.com/schpet/linear-cli/pull/208); thanks @mbuvarp)
- add issue_create_assign_self config option to control default self-assignment on issue create ([#208](https://github.com/schpet/linear-cli/pull/208); thanks @mbuvarp)
- add document comments to document view --json output ([#235](https://github.com/schpet/linear-cli/pull/235); thanks @josephyooo)
- show a blocked indicator in issue mine and issue query output, and surface inverseRelations in --json
- download inline images in document view so terminal renderers see local paths, and add --no-download to skip it

### Changed

- issue view now orders comment threads chronologically (oldest first), matching Linear's UI
- guard document update against replacing content when active inline comments exist, since the replacement orphans their anchors; pass --force to override ([#235](https://github.com/schpet/linear-cli/pull/235); thanks @josephyooo)

## [2.0.0] - 2026-04-03

### Fixed

- alphanumeric team keys (e.g. team keys with numbers) now accepted
- workspace flag collision: removed -w short alias from --workspace to avoid conflict with --web
- auth migrate keyring error message now includes suggestion

### Changed

- json output now preserves GraphQL field names and connection shape across all commands
- issue view resolved thread metadata format

### Added

- `issue list` split into `issue mine` and `issue query`. `mine` is your personal work queue (unstarted issues assigned to you). `query` handles cross-team filtering, --json output, and full-text search via --search. `issue list` is aliased to `mine` for now but should be considered deprecated
